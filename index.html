   <h1>Welcome to Better Bike ABQ<br></h1>
   <left_col>
    <h3>The question seemed simple, where are the safest roads in Albuquerque to ride a <br>
    bike?  As a bicycle enthusiast it was my personal interests that gave the spark for this<br>
     project.  It started as a class project and grew into this website. With Much help from <br>
     Jennifer Buntz of the Duke City Wheelmen I was able to build several maps displaying <br>
     bicycle related accidents in the ABQ metro area.  What I discovered was there are many <br>
     areas of town that boost a high incident of accidents.  The factors for these accidents <br>
     are many, as it is difficult to surmise only one definitive contributing factor.  This <br>
     site hopes to highlight Danger Zones in the ABQ metro area as well as provide some sage <br>
     advice for best riding practices in the city.  It is my hope to improve ridership as a <br>
     whole and to keep both riders and drivers safe.  Enjoy!
