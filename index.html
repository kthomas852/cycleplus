   <h1>Welcome to Better Bike ABQ<br></h1>
   
    <h3>This site hopes to inform both recreational and commuter rides alike of the riding dangers Areas in Albuquerque.  <br>
    	As a bicycle enthusiast it was my personal interest that gave the spark for this map.  This project started as a <br>
    	class project and grew into a website as I wanted more and more information about the issue.  The question seemed <br>
        simple, where are the safest roads in Albuquerque to ride a bike?  With Much help from Jennifer Buntz of the Duke <br>
        City Wheelmen I was able to obtain some accident data gathered by the NMDOT.  Using this data I located the accidents <br>
        on a map of Albuquerque in the hope that safe biking paths in the city would be obvious.  What I discovered was there <br>
        are many areas of town that boost a high incident of accidents.  The factors for these accidents are many, as it is<br>
         difficult to surmise only one definitive contributing factor from the data.  This site hopes to highlight Danger <br>
         Zones in the ABQ metro area as well as provide some gathered advice for best riding practices in the city.  This site <br>
         hopes to improve ridership as a whole and to keep both riders and drivers safe as both have a responsibility to watch<br>
         out for the other.
